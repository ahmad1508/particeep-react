In this project I created a movie Gallery. the movies are displayed and identified by a color depending on their categories
I had difficulties using the array being exported i usually use json server with fetch method which i found easier or database if i'm working with a back-end

I used material UI for the design which helped display the cards.

To run the project first download the files
Once the file download go to your terminal to the project directory and run 
```javascript
npm install
```
to install the modules required to run the project

Then run the following command 

```javascript
npm run start 
```
and here you go

Hope you'll like the project in regards to the working functionalitiesüòÅ
